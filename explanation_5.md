Problem 5: blockchain
==========================
For this problem, I used double linked list instead of linked list because with double linked list, it is easier to access the previous hash.

Time complexity
--------------------------
The complexity of the algorithm is basically constant since the operations are appending to the tail of the double linked list, and accessing previous hash of a node.

Space complexity
-----------------
The space complexity of the algorithm is linear i.e. O(n), where n is size of the blockchain.
